The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly with units. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not produce the intended result if the parent container's width is not explicitly defined or is itself calculated.  Another common issue is the order of operations within the `calc()` function. Make sure to use parentheses appropriately to control the order of calculations.  Finally, be aware of potential browser compatibility issues; while widely supported, very old browsers may not support `calc()` correctly.
